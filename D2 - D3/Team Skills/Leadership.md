# Leadership

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates additional leadership skills such as imparting knowledge and expertise to their team, helping them to understand what needs to be built and why, and encouraging a collaborative environment.

### Experience Justification
At Andela, I've functioned as a cohort rep, held several positions in Teencode and also a member of the engineering council. 

While performing the activities involved with the above listed roles, I've had to lead teams. I've come to understand that being a leader is first and foremost a collaborative effort, its not one person giving orders, but us coming together as a team to ensure that our goal is achieved. As a leader its your responsbility to ensure that team has a full understanding of what the goal is, and the required expertise to achieve it.
