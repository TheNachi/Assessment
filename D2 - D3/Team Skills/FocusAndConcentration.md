# Focus and Concentration

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and knows how to keep his team focused on the client's top priorities but also knows when to stop pushing to avoid team or individual burnout.

### Experience Justification
Being able to balance expectations and/or pressure and maintain a healthy work life balance is a needed skill for any developer to successful. Being able to correctly prioritize on work output ensures that tean remains very efficient and that the partners are happy.

While fleshing out tickets on Jira board, we always assign level of priority to tickets, on a range of "High", "Medium", "Low". This helps in knowing the tickets most important to work on, also when working on sprints, we ensure to check in with the product manager on priorities.

To ensure that the team is working effectively, there's a need to ensure that an individual is not given tasks that is more than his skill level and allocated time isn't unrealistic. Also ensure that team members take vacations when and if necessary.
