# Speaking to be Understood

### Expectation
The Developer speaks in a manner (audibility, pace) that allows others to engage and understand. They are able to rephrase a concept using different perspectives or vocabulary in order to exhibit a thorough understanding of the subject. The Developer can present important information to teams and stakeholders they interact with frequently.

### Experience Justification
In my day to day activities, I've to continously communicate with all stakeholders on my engagement. During standups, I have to speak on what the team has been working on, what our blockers(if any) are and also field questions from other team mates. During our Demo calls, I explain and demonstrate to all stakeholders updates, bugfixes or new features that have been added to the app, I answer questions and take feedback based on my presentation.

While working on tasks that need me to interface with other teams, I've had to organise meeting with stakeholders from other teams and present necessary information to them, ensuring that every stakeholder is clear on the problem to be solved or goal to be achieved and the role they need to play.
