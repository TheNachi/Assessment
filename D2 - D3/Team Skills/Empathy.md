# Empathy

### Expectation
The Developer is sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of people on their team. They also guide other members of their team to consider and respond appropriately to the needs and feelings of different people in different situations.

### Experience Justification
When working on a team, its very important for their to be a healthy dose of empathy, a sensitivity to peoples feelings, thoughts and experiences, also understanding how best people work and being able to give them space when they need it, or hearing them out when they need to talk to someone.

I try to do my work in a way that makes it easy for members of my team to do theirs instead making work harder and painful for them, I try to ensure that when we're swapped with a busy schedule, not to take too much of their time during standups and lengthy conversations on slack. I try to ensure my teammates are as autonomous as possible as I've noticed this increases creativity.

I try to have a general introductory sync with every new member of my team. I try to understand their background, and experiences as a person. I also try to identify our cultural differences. This helps me relate with them much better and ensures I am able to empatize with them in different scenarios
