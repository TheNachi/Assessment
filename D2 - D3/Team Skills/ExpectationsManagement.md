# Expectations Management

### Expectation
The Developer is able to manage the expectations of others regarding the output of the team as a whole and of individual members. They are also able to manage the expectations of the team themselves..

### Experience Justification
Setting and delivering on expectations is a very valuable skill for a software developer, whether working in team or as an individual. Expectations management means being able to identify reasonable and unreasonable expectations from the outset, this starts with knowing what is expected of you and your team members, what you(your team) can do and what you(your team) can't do. Being able to determine this would would ensure that you set the right expectations. Expectations management also entails carrying all stakeholders along as the work progresses and if there is need to realign on deadlines, doing that on time.

On my partner engagement, we work in sprints which usually last for a period of 2 weeks and for each sprint, at the beginning of each sprint, we decide on timeline, we use a story point system to estimate how long we think it would take to complete a ticket. We also have different columns that help in defining at what point a ticket is. A ticket could be in "To Do", "Blocked", "In Progress", "Code Review", "QA" or "Done". This keeps everyone informed on what the team is working on at each point in time.
