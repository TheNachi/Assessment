# Accountablity

### Expectation
The Developer guides others on the team about the importance of taking responsibility and accounting for one's actions.

### Experience Justification
Accountability is a very important for developers as this helps in managing expectations by building trust. To take responsibility means you need to be able to account for the actions you take, and for the success or failure of the task. This helps stakeholders better assess issues when they arise. 

I encourage team members to take ownership of the tasks they work on, and to ensure they see the task through from start to deployment. I encourage my teammates to thoroughly review PRs, make observations when they notice things not going the way it should as the success of the team is dependent on all of us.

I ensure that my team mates don't see making mistakes as a failure but as an opportunity to do better and this helps in ensuring people don't shy away from accountability.
