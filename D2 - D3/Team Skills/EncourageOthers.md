# Encourages Others

### Expectation
The Developer is able to give others support, confidence and hope. They can constructively persuade and stimulate others to continue something with strong work ethics. They show appreciation for the contributions of others, and give others credit for their work.

### Experience Justification
One of the benefits of being part of a team is having other people, who can speak to you and encourage you when you're feeling burnt out, appreciate you for your contributions to the team, and encourage you on the work being done. Team morale is very important for team productivity.

When a new developer joined my team recently, I was on hand to support him through his onboarding period, help him integrate properly with team, show him ways out of tough spots and make his transition into the team, fairly seamless

As Country Lead for teencode ensuring that team morale is always high is very vital, as there's no financial reward for the work we do, so I always take out time check up on team members, always appreciating the little things they do and making sure people are aware of how they work they do, is impacting our community.
