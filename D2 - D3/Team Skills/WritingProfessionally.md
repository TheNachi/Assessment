# Writing Profesionally

### Expectation
The Developer is adept at writing communications to senior management focused on highlighting key issues and calls for action.

### Experience Justification
I've built up my experience in writing professionally by taking up responsiblity for drafting most of the written materials we make use of on the engagement

Recently we started a re-write of our codebase, I took up the responsibility of writing a comprehensive readme for the project.
Per a request from our product manager, I compiled a list of best practices we would be using for the re-write.
Also as part of my day to day activities, I've needed to document bug reporting, compose and send email to all stakeholders on the engagement and post daily updates on the status of tasks that I'm working on.
