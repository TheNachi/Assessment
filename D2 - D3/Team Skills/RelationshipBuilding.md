# Relationship Building

### Expectation
The Developer has the ability to establish themselves as a trusted advisor to their company. Leadership sees them as having the company's best interest at hand and capable of giving unbiased advice.

### Experience Justification
Building a healthy relationship with both your team mates, team leads and stakeholders on an engagement encourages good communication, and proper stakeholder management.

I always make an effort to checking up on my team mates and knowing how they are faring in their everyday life. This helps me to gain their trust and make them feel free to approach me whenever they need my help and are comfortable with both asking me questions and giving feedback.

In Andela Lagos I'm a member of the Engineering Council, this affords me the opportunity to build reationships with alot of engineers, understand their pain points and be able to pass these along to management. Also management trusts me to always be objective in giving advice and serving as a go between.
