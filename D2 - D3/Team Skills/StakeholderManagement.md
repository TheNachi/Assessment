# Stakeholder Management

### Expectation
The Developer includes junior members of their team as stakeholders and understands how to appropriately communicate the right level of information to them..

### Experience Justification
Identifying stakeholders when dealing with any tasks (software development related or not) and communicating the right information to them is a skillset I strongly believe to be important as a software engineer.

Recently on of my team members left and had to be replaced. I had to help in onboarding the new team member, communicating to him all necessary information he needed to fully integrate into the team, and always helping him out when he needed help. 

As Teencode Country Lead, I have a lot of junior team members, being able to coordinate them, understand where everyone fits in and and appropriately communicate the required level of information to each person, has helped me in fuflilling this obligation.
