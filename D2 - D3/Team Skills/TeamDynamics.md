# Team Dynamics

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of a team and how they are responsible not only for their own individual contributions, but mentoring other team members to increase the overall effectiveness of the team.

### Experience Justification
As a senior member, I am responsible for the team’s effectiveness. Which means I am in charge of making sure that other team members deliver on time and with quality. I am to communicate deadlines and expectations to other team members, ensure that they’re on track and that they’re unblocked whenever they face blockers.

I totally understand that I’m no longer only responsible for only my contributions but I pay good attention to the contributions of other members of the team, and understand the bigger picture better. I’m also always quick to audit our processes and codebase and suggest areas of improvements and more specifically how to implement those improvements.
