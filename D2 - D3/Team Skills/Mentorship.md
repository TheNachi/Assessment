# Mentorship

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to coach knowledge-seeking developers in best practices in a manner that helps the mentee accelerate their knowledge and growth.

### Experience Justification
Overtime in my capacities as a member of teencode, a Product Owner for a simulations team and also on my partner work, I've been opportuned to mentor other developers. 

As a Product Owner I was able to mentor the simulations team on design thinking and how to create intuitive layouts. Before I started my partner engagement, I mentored a junior developer on React Native, built an App with him to guide him.

As a teencode facilitator, I've been to high schools to coach teengers through the introductory part of programming.
