# Self Awareness

### Expectation
The Developer has a strong awareness of self and seeks feedback from others regarding their actions and behaviours. They continuously seek to improve weak areas. They make efforts to understand the behaviours of those around them, and make effective use of this understanding.

### Experience Justification
Strong awareness of self, ones weakness and strength is very vital for every developer who strives to be a master of his craft. I'm always working on my self and improving on who I was yesterday. I try to engage in conversations with my teammates as to how my actions impact them, while doing this I also constantly seek feedback from them to know if I'm on the right path or if I need to do better.

It’s important to create meaningful relationships that aren’t work only related. By forming this extra relationship with team members, I can better relate with them, make them feel appreciated as a team mate and better manage my expectations for them and theirs of me.

I’m careful to identify potential areas of improvement for myself through the interactions with more experienced engineers on my team. I also careful understand the behaviours of those I interact with to better guide my interactions with them.
