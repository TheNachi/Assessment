# Reading to Understand

### Expectation
The Developer is able to identify and convey the key points of material and content read. They are adept at reading documentation, code, or emails and deriving all required information from them.

### Experience Justification
Written communication is the most used form of communication on my engagement, whether by slack, emails or Jira. So for every written material that is either directed to me, my team or I come across, I ensure that I get a good grasp of what message is being passed across. Also as part of my learning process I have to read documentation, and other people's code, this has greatly helped me along in my journey as a software developer. When I recently started on my engagement, I had to work on an inherited codebase, for me to implement any new feature or fix a bug, I had to take time to read and study the codebase.

Reading and understanding user stories on JIRA, helps me in doing my work as this is how features, bugs or improvements are reported. I've also learnt to ask questions to seek clarification as this help to shed more light, if there's any Jira case that is not clearly stated.
