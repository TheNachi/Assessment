# Vision Alignment 

### Expectation
The Developer is able to articulate their company's vision and understands how their work helps the company achieve their goals.

### Experience Justification
Vision alignment is one of the most important factors to me when it comes to any company I wanna work with. I only want to work in a company whoseâ€™s mission, vision and values align with my current and long term goals and values.
 
The Vision of Ragnar is to promote personal achievement through the help of teams, the joy of achieving something together that you could never do alone. Ragnar organizes non-competitive races for people who seek adventure, love fitness and the outdoors and also to encourage team bonding.

I understand how my work impacts the company, I work on the mobile team, and the mobile app is a race day App, that enhances the race day experience of the runners. On the app all the necessary information that the Runner needs is available also they can interact with their team members and view memories from their past races.
