# Management

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to manage junior members of their team by clearly setting expectations, by helping them to improve as developers through the delivery of prioritized, value-adding work, and by helping them grow as contributing members of a technical team.

### Experience Justification
I recently was a product owner for a simulations project, I was able to manage the product related part of the project and we were able to successfully complete the project in due time. 

While as bootcamp learning facilitator I was able to successful manage junior developers by constantly using myself and my outputs to set examples, setting expectations for them to not only improve themselves as developers but also become better leaders in their own right, adding value by taking ownership of their work and having an unbiased opinion of contributions brought in by their fellow team mates.
