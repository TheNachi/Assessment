# Adaptability

### Expectation
The Developer is able to help other members of their team adapt to change and recognise its value.

### Experience Justification
Adaptability requires adjusting to changing environments, requirements and expectations.

One thing that happens regularly in software development is changing requirements and the developer has to change to meet these requirements, recently on my partner engagement we had to change from using googlemaps to mapbox, and we already had features webuilt out with googlemaps. When the decision to move was made, we came together as a team and maped out a way to make the transition seamless. 

As a team we've had to make a lot of changes during out design process, one thing that has helped us best is recognizing that change is very necessary in software devlopment and helping each other adapt to this change.
