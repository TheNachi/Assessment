# Object Oriented Programming

### Expectation
The Developer should have a very sound understanding of object relationships and be able to use this knowledge to design a complete system, taking into account the different possible users and interactions.

### Experience Justification
I have a good understanding of OOP.

I've used encapsulation to define private and public variables and methods, allowing other objects to use only the variables and methods that are public. 
This also makes use of the principle of abstraction since it abstracts away complex functionality in the private variables and methods and only exposes the public ones, making it easy to use objects without knowing their internal workings.

Most of the objects/or classes I've written on my partner engagement were extensions of already existing classes. Inheritance allows me to create child classes that inherit (or extend) from parent classes enabling me to reuse the common logic and extract the unique logic into the new class.

I also maintain SOLID principles when writing programs.

1. Single Responsibility Principle: a class/function/methods should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle: software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
3. Liskov substitution principle: subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. Interface Segregation Principle: clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: high level modules should not depend on low level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
